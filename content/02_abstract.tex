We present a software environment for mobile thermal mapping solutions which is easy to setup and flexible to use.
There are three parts, one to get the data from the sensors and provide them to the whole software system, one to record and safe the data and a third to process the data in lessons.

ROS is used as the core framework where all sensors publish their measurements.
ROS also provides the tools to visualize the data and save them in the ROS Bag format.
Online processing can also be done either in ROS within a native ROS node or with a MATLAB ROS node.

To process the data offline the ROS Bags are used in either ROS or with our developed MATLAB application.
The application can be used with a GUI as standalone solution to extract datapoints from the ROS Bag or as a API inside other MATLAB programs.

The developed scripts accelerate the onboarding process for new team members or students in lectures.
